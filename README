We evaluate our secure gradient descent protocol for two analytic use-cases: linear regression and binary classification
(logistic regression) with horizontal data partitioning. We also evaluate our protocol with vertically partitioned data for the linear regression use-case. 

We compare three scenarios:
1. Centralized trusted (CT), where the parties transfer their entire raw data to a trusted mediator to perform the analysis,
2. Distributed trusted (DT), where parties execute gradient descent locally and share intermediate results with a trusted mediator to aggregate, and
3. Distributed untrusted (DU), where parties execute gradient descent locally and share encrypted intermediate results with an
untrusted mediator.
